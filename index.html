  <h3>Legacy and Commitment</h3>
    <p>
    Lantern Properties Ltd. is a multi-generational, multi-family housing operator and developer founded in 1962 by Arthur & Arlene Hayes. The family's first commercial property was a low-rise concrete apartment building in the Ambleside
    neighbourhood of West Vancouver. Since then, Lantern has steadily grown its portfolio to include properties in several east and west-side Vancouver neighborhoods, as well as the James Bay, Upper Fort, and Rockland areas of Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2015, Lantern initiated and successfully completed a programme to add density to existing sites. Lantern remains committed to providing high-quality housing, managed conscientiously and responsibly, and looks forward to breaking ground on two new multi-family projects in 2019/20. Lantern is actively involved with Landlord BC and the Urban Development Institute, a reflection of Lantern's commitment to the communities in which it operates.

    <em>
    Acknowledgment of Unceded Indigenous Territories
    </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    At Lantern Properties we recognize and honor the long-standing history of the land on which our rental properties in Vancouver, BC and Victoria, BC reside. We acknowledge that these lands are situated on the traditional and unceded territories of the Indigenous Peoples, including the Coast Salish, the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations in Vancouver, and the Lekwungen-speaking peoples, specifically the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations, in Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the spirit of reconciliation and respect, we express our gratitude for the opportunity to live, work, and thrive on these lands. As a responsible business owner and developer, we are committed to fostering understanding, cooperation, and lasting relationships with the Indigenous communities whose territories we occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
    We encourage our tenants and visitors to learn about the rich cultural heritage of these Indigenous Nations and to appreciate the resilience and contributions of these communities to the fabric of our society. By acknowledging and honoring their unceded territories, we aim to foster a climate of respect, awareness, and shared responsibility in our communities.
    </p>
    <p>
    As we move forward together, let us all strive to create a future rooted in collaboration, equity, and understanding, where we cherish and nurture the land and its people for generations to come.
