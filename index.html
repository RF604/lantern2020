  <h3>
    Lantern Properties Ltd. is a multi-generational, multi-family housing operator and developer founded in 1962 by Arthur & Arlene Hayes. The family's first commercial property was a low-rise concrete apartment building in the Ambleside
    neighbourhood of West Vancouver. Since then, Lantern has steadily grown its portfolio to include properties in several east and west-side Vancouver neighborhoods, as well as the James Bay, Upper Fort, and Rockland areas of Victoria.
    <br><br>
    In 2015, Lantern initiated and successfully completed a programme to add density to existing sites. Lantern remains committed to providing high-quality housing, managed conscientiously and responsibly, and looks forward to breaking ground on two new multi-family projects in 2019/20. Lantern is actively involved with Landlord BC and the Urban Development Institute, a reflection of Lantern's commitment to the communities in which it operates.
