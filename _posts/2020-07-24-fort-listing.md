**The Apartment**  
This apartment home is on the nicest part of Fort Street past the traffic volumes and noise of downtown. It is on the first floor. It is very peaceful and bright. We have recent replaced common area flooring to a very nice hardwood laminate which is easy to keep clean and has a great appearance. We have also updated the bathroom. It is a lovely home sparkling clean.  
It is generously sized at 588 square feet. It has generous closet space. It has its own large semi-private balcony. It will just sparkle when you take possession. All of the transit stops are directly across the street steps from the building entrance. Frankly, the interior pictures we have are terrible.

**Walkscore  
– Walker's Paradise!** (Score of 95)  
– **Excellent Transit!** (Score of 71, nearby are 22 Vic/Hillside, 14 Vic/UVic, 19 Hillside Mall, 11 UVic Tillicum Mall)  
– **Bikers Paradise!** (Score of 100, flat as a pancake)

**Nearby + On-site Amenities**  
– Nearby parks include Pioneer Square, Stadacona Park and Royal Athletic Park  
– Nice clean laundry room  
– Storage locker  
– Very quiet hallways

**Big Savings on Internet**  
We have an exclusive deal with Telus for Optik internet. They don't permit us to publish the rate but you will have access to the same rates as Telus employees. Factor that in when you are calculating value. Almost every Lantern resident uses the plan.

**What's Allowed and What's Not!**  
All of our tenancy agreements contain a non-smoking term. There are one or two legacy tenants in the building that are not restricted from smoking in their units and on their balconies. We do our very best to offer a smoke and pet free environment. We strictly enforce both to the limits legal available!  
What's Included  
Included in the rent is hot water and window coverings. We have onsite covered parking at reasonable rates.
