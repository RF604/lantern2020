**The Apartment**  
  
This apartment home is on the nicest part of Fort Street past the traffic volumes and noise of downtown. It is on the first floor. It is very peaceful and bright. We have recent replaced common area flooring to a very nice hardwood laminate which is easy to keep clean and has a great appearance. We have also updated the bathroom. It is a lovely home sparkling clean.   
  
. It is generously sized at 588 square feet. It has generous closet space. It has its own large semi-private balcony. It will just sparkle when you take possession. All of the transit stops are directly across the street steps from the building entrance.  
  
Frankly, the interior pictures we have are terrible.
