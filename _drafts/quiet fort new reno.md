**The Apartment**  
This apartment home is on the nicest part of Fort Street past the traffic volumes and noise of downtown. It faces north and is on the ground level with its own private entrance and patio. Outside on the patio you are in the midst of the lush and private landscaping that separates this building from the neighbours. We have installed new window coverings and new lighting as well as new flooring.  
It is generously sized at 500 square feet. It has generous closet space. It will just sparkle when you take possession. All of the transit stops are directly across the street steps from the building entrance.
