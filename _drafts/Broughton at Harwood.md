**The Building Location**  
Our Building is in the heart of the west end, just a short half block to Sunset Beach, less than 100m from Davie Street, and about 4 blocks east of Denman.  
  
Walk ScoreÂ® gives this location a walk score of 93, a Transit Score of 85 and a Bike Score of 87. It is very close to Sunset Beach Park, English Bay Beach Park and Nelson Park.  
  
The 023 Main Street Powell and 006 Davie Street transit stops are less than 200M away on Davie and skytrain is 1.4 km away. The Expo and Canada lines are 1.4 km away.  
  
**The Apartment**  
The Apartment is on the south west of the building on the 2nd floor and is bright and clean. You get a really nice outlook over quiet Harwood Street (traffic calmed) through the mature trees. It is on the quiet side of a building which itself is on a quiet street that has been traffic calmed for years. The home faces south so it is nice and bright. We have recently replaced the floors on the main floor and have completed a beautiful lobby renovation. We reinvest heavily in our buildings.  
  
**The Condition of the Apartment**  
This Apartment has been nicely looked after by the current tenant. It has some of the art deco features from when the building was constructed. It shows beautifully. It has the beautiful real hardwood floors everywhere but the kitchen and bathroom. Nice wide venetian blinds on the windows.  
  
**Saving You Money on Internet**  
We have an exclusive deal with Telus for the lowest price on Optik TV and Internet that is available. It is the same rate offered to Telus employees. Telus does not permit us to publish the rates but the annual rate for 15G internet will save you a considerable amount of money over the course of a year. These plans are the best value available to BC customers of Telus whether new or existing.  
  
**What's Included**  
Heat, hot water and window coverings are included in the rent. Secure underground parking is periodically available and always at modest rates. We have huge storage lockers available for a modest charge. We have two enormous expanded metal caged bike storage lockers for your bike. They are bright and recently constructed.  
  
**We are just waiting for our new MODO co-op electric car. It is right on the premises and they are replacing the previous can because they had some problems with it.**  
  
**Pricing**  
We are renting this Apartment for $1,575.00. It is less expensive than anything in the neighbourhood and if you factor in the internet savings, we believe the value is unbeatable.  
  
**Restrictions!**  
Lantern provides all of its residents with a pet free and smoke free environment. If you are a smoker, please don't apply for a home with us and then go ahead and smoke on the balcony. That does not work for us. Similarly, trying to conceal a pet will only get you a notice to end tenancy....  
  
**Our Commitment**  
We are a family owned and operated business. We take great care of all of our properties and pride in them. We believe the photos bear that out.  
  
We don't neglect repairs when you need them and generally speaking, as long as a tradesperson is available, we will look after non-emergency problems within 48 hours.  
  
  
**Viewings**  
Ayala our manager will be showing the suite. Please text her at 604-724-8031 or email to schedule something if you are interested.
