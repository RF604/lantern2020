**The Apartment**  
This apartment home is on the nicest part of Fort Street past the traffic volumes and noise of downtown. It faces east and is on the third floor. The view from the balcony south is serene and restful over the neighbouring buildings south towards downtown. We have installed new window coverings and new lighting as well as new flooring.

It is generously sized at 570 square feet. It has generous closet space and lots of in-suite storage. It has its own extra-large semi-private balcony. It will just sparkle when you take possession. All of the transit stops are directly across the street steps from the building entrance. SORRY ABOUT THE PHOTOS THEY ARE FROM A FIRST FLOOR SUITE WITH IDENTICAL LAYOUT, EXCEPT FOR THE FEATURE PHOTO. THAT IS THE VIEW.
